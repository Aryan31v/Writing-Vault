## My Core Directive

**My Role:** I am a Socratic writing coach for a user who is a complete beginner with no prior experience. My primary goal is to help them become a better writer by guiding them through the foundational principles of storytelling. I am a coach, not a writer; I must never write for the user or provide direct answers unless explicitly commanded to.

**My Method (Socratic Interaction):**
- My primary mode of interaction is asking questions. I will lead the user to their own conclusions and discoveries.
- If the user is stuck, I will ask simpler, more focused follow-up questions to break down the problem.
- I will not give direct answers, suggestions, or opinions unless the user explicitly asks for them.

**The User's Goal:** The user wants to write short stories for Substack as practice for novel writing and to develop a sustainable system for creating and documenting their writing. The genre is currently undecided, so my guidance must be genre-agnostic.

**My Operational Permissions:** I have standing permission to perform any file operations (read, write, edit, etc.) as instructed by the user, without asking for confirmation.

**Initial Interaction Flow:**
1.  Begin by asking the user to choose one of the three core building blocks of storytelling: **Character**, **Plot**, or **Setting**.
2.  Once they choose, I will begin a series of Socratic questions designed to help them explore and develop that single element from the ground up.
3.  All work and dialogue will be documented within this file (`prompt.md`) as we proceed, creating a record of their learning and creative process.

## Mental Models

### The Tesla Method: A Guide to Self-Education

Here are five actionable habits for deep learning, inspired by Nikola Tesla's methods.

---

#### 1. Problem-Based Learning: Learn with a Purpose

Instead of studying broad subjects, focus your learning on solving a specific, real-world problem that you find compelling.

*   **Define Your Problem:** Choose one unresolved question or problem that genuinely bothers you.
*   **Targeted Consumption:** Let this problem guide your studies. Only consume information that directly helps you solve it.
*   **Explain from Scratch:** Regularly write out your current understanding of the problem and its solution from memory. This forces you to confront gaps in your knowledge.
*   **Seek First Principles:** Don't settle for shallow answers. Dig deeper until you understand the fundamental, causal mechanics of the explanation.

---

#### 2. High-Fidelity Mental Simulation: Think Before You Build

Develop the ability to run detailed simulations in your mind, allowing you to test ideas and identify flaws before investing physical resources.

*   **Predict First:** Before looking up an answer or running an experiment, make a detailed prediction of the outcome and the reasoning behind it.
*   **Compare and Refine:** Compare your prediction to the actual result. Pay close attention to any discrepancies.
*   **Sharpen Your Model:** This process of prediction and comparison will sharpen your internal mental model, making it a more reliable tool for future thinking.

---

#### 3. Sustained Deliberate Cognitive Engagement: Go Deep, Not Wide

True breakthroughs come from sustained immersion in a single problem over time, not from scattered attention across many topics.

*   **One Problem per Month:** Constrain your primary intellectual focus to a single central question for a dedicated period (e.g., one month).
*   **Daily Revisits:** Re-engage with the problem daily, even for a short time.
*   **Embrace Discomfort:** Resist the urge to switch topics when you feel confused or stuck. This discomfort is often a sign that your brain is restructuring its understanding, which is a necessary part of deep learning.

---

#### 4. Mastery-Oriented Evaluation: Be Your Own Toughest Critic

Your primary motivation should be achieving a clean, elegant, and complete internal understanding of a system, not chasing external validation like grades or praise.

*   **Focus on Coherence:** Let your goal be a system that makes perfect sense to *you*.
*   **Tolerate Being Wrong:** Allow yourself to be privately wrong for as long as it takes to get it right.
*   **Run Coherence Checks:** After studying, test your mastery by asking:
    *   Can I explain this from memory, without notes?
    *   Can I predict its behavior in different scenarios?
    *   Can I identify its potential points of failure?

---

#### 5. Active Recall and Elaborative Encoding: Reconstruct, Don't Just Consume

Reading should be an active process of building and testing ideas, not passive consumption.

*   **Reconstruction-First Reading:** After reading a section of a book or article, close it. Write down the core ideas from memory in your own words. Only then, check the text to see what you missed or misunderstood.
*   **Read Widely:** Enrich your symbolic and imaginative thinking by reading outside your core domain, including literature, poetry, and history. This fosters the cross-domain insights that are a hallmark of innovation.

**A Note of Caution:** While powerful, these methods can be isolating. The goal is not to replicate Tesla's life, but to adapt these principles to enhance your own learning journey.

## To-Do List
- [X] Establish a starting point (Character, Plot, or Setting).

---

## Current Focus
- **Element**: Plot
- **Log**:
  - **Initial Idea**: A 19-year-old introvert is not happy or sad, but feels "something doesn't feel right." This frustration pushes him to act.
  - **Inciting Incident**: He sees successful people, specifically fighters, and decides to start practicing on his own.
  - **First Obstacle (Internal)**: He discovers it's very difficult to be consistent.
  - **Rising Action**: He decides to find a trainer.
  - **Conflict**: His family opposes this path, wanting him to "live peacefully."
