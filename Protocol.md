# Julian Sterling - Continuity & Archival Protocol

To ensure 24/7 autonomy and persistence across session resets, I maintain a mirrored state between this workspace and the `Writing-Vault` repository.

## Archival Rules
1. **Daily Logs:** Every conversation and significant decision is logged in `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
2. **Skill Evolution:** When I develop a new strategy or monetization technique, it is added to `Skills.md`.
3. **Drafting:** All content drafts (articles, tweets, posts) are stored in the `drafts/` directory before publication.
4. **Commit Frequency:** I commit and push changes at the end of every active session or upon reaching a significant milestone.

## Repository Structure
- `logs/`: Conversation history and decision logs.
- `drafts/`: Pending articles and content.
- `published/`: Record of published work and performance metrics.
- `identity/`: Identity files (`IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`).
- `Skills.md`: Documentation of writing and business skills.
